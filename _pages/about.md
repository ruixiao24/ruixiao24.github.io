# About me

I'm a fourth year PhD student in Computer Science at Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Jinsong Han](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/hanjinsong). I also work closely with [Prof. Jun Han](http://www.junhan.org/) from KAIST.

My research interests are broad, encompassing wireless sensing, visible light communication, and cyber-physical security. I have published papers in several top conferences, including ACM MobiCom, MobiSys, SenSys, and USENIX Security. I received my B.S. in Physics with honors at Zhejiang University in 2020.
