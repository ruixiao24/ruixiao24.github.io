# About me

I'm a second year graduate student in Computer Science at Zhejiang University under the supervision of Prof. Jinsong Han. My research interests revolve around wireless sensing and cyber-physical security.

Previously, I was an undergraduate research assistant in SENSG Lab, lead by [Dr. Jun Han](http://www.junhan.org/), at National University of Singapore. I received my B.S. in Physics at Zhejiang University as well.
