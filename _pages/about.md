# About me

I'm a fifth-year PhD student in Computer Science at Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Jinsong Han](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/hanjinsong). I also work closely with [Prof. Jun Han](http://www.junhan.org/) from KAIST.

My research interests lie at the intersection of ***security*** and ***mobile/wireless/sensing systems***. Currently, my work spans applications in wireless sensing, visible light communication, and cyber-physical security, with a particular focus on the innovative analysis of physical signals to drive advancements in these areas. I have published papers in several top conferences, including ACM MobiCom, MobiSys, SenSys, and USENIX Security. I received my B.S. in Physics with honors at Zhejiang University in 2020.
